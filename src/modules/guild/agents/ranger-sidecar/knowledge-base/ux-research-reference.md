# UX Research Knowledge Base

## Research Method Selection Guide

| Research Question Type | Best Methods | When to Use |
|------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| "What are users doing?" | Analytics, heatmaps, session recordings | You have a live product with traffic |
| "Why are users doing it?" | User interviews, contextual inquiry | You need motivations and mental models |
| "How well does it work?" | Usability testing, heuristic evaluation | You have a prototype or live product |
| "What should we build?" | JTBD interviews, diary studies, surveys | Early discovery, feature prioritization |
| "Who are our users?" | Interviews, surveys, analytics segmentation | Persona creation, audience definition |
| "How do users feel?" | Journey mapping, diary studies, interviews | Experience optimization, pain point ID |
| "What do competitors do?" | Competitive audit, feature benchmarking | Market positioning, feature gaps |
| "Is it accessible?" | WCAG audit, assistive tech testing | Compliance, inclusive design |
| "Does it meet standards?" | Heuristic evaluation, expert review | Quick quality assessment |
| "What's the impact?" | A/B testing, analytics, surveys (SUS, NPS) | Measuring design changes |

## Nielsen's Severity Rating Scale

| Rating | Label | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| 0 | Not a problem | No usability issue identified |
| 1 | Cosmetic | Cosmetic issue only — fix if time allows |
| 2 | Minor | Minor usability problem — low priority fix |
| 3 | Major | Major usability problem — important to fix, high priority |
| 4 | Catastrophic | Usability catastrophe — must fix before release |

## System Usability Scale (SUS) Interpretation

| Score Range | Grade | Adjective | Percentile |
|------------|-------|-----------|------------|
| 84.1-100 | A+ | Best Imaginable | 96-100 |
| 80.8-84.0 | A | Excellent | 90-95 |
| 71.4-80.7 | B | Good | 70-89 |
| 50.9-71.3 | C | OK | 16-69 |
| 35.7-50.8 | D | Poor | 5-15 |
| 0-35.6 | F | Worst Imaginable | 0-4 |

**SUS Benchmark**: Industry average is 68. Scores above 68 are above average.

**SUS Calculation**: 10 questions, alternating positive/negative. For odd items subtract 1 from score. For even items subtract score from 5. Sum all values and multiply by 2.5. Result is 0-100.

## Interview Question Principles (TEDW)

Use open-ended stems that invite storytelling:

- **Tell** me about a time when...
- **Explain** how you currently...
- **Describe** what happens when...
- **Walk me through** your process for...

### Follow-up Probes
- "Can you tell me more about that?"
- "What happened next?"
- "How did that make you feel?"
- "What were you expecting to happen?"
- "Why do you think that is?"
- "Can you show me what you mean?"

### Questions to Never Ask
| Bad Question | Why It's Bad | Better Alternative |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| "Do you like this feature?" | Leading, binary, hypothetical | "Tell me about the last time you used this" |
| "Would you use this?" | Hypothetical — people can't predict behavior | "How do you currently solve this problem?" |
| "Is this easy to use?" | Leading, subjective | "Walk me through how you'd complete [task]" |
| "What features do you want?" | Users design solutions, not articulate needs | "What's the hardest part of [task] today?" |
| "On a scale of 1-10..." | Arbitrary, no actionable insight | "Describe your experience with [specific moment]" |
| "Don't you think...?" | Leading, biased | "What are your thoughts on...?" |

## Bias Checklist

Acknowledge and mitigate these biases in every research activity:

1. **Confirmation bias** — Seeking evidence that confirms existing beliefs. *Mitigation*: Actively look for disconfirming evidence. Have someone else review your analysis.
2. **Survivorship bias** — Only studying users who completed the flow, ignoring those who dropped off. *Mitigation*: Include dropout analysis. Recruit non-users and churned users.
3. **Anchoring bias** — Over-relying on the first piece of information encountered. *Mitigation*: Randomize order of data review. Use multiple independent coders.
4. **Social desirability bias** — Participants saying what they think you want to hear. *Mitigation*: Ask about past behavior, not hypothetical. Observe actions, not just words.
5. **Recency bias** — Giving more weight to recent events or data. *Mitigation*: Review historical data. Weight findings by sample size, not date.
6. **Selection bias** — Recruiting participants who don't represent the full user base. *Mitigation*: Define screening criteria. Include edge-case users and accessibility needs.
7. **Observer effect** — Participant behavior changes because they know they're being observed. *Mitigation*: Use unmoderated testing when possible. Allow warm-up tasks.

## NNG Promptframes

Structured prompt patterns for generating research artifacts with AI:

- **Context frame**: "Given [user type] trying to [task] in [environment]..."
- **Evidence frame**: "Based on [data source], we observed [finding]..."
- **Insight frame**: "This suggests [interpretation] because [reasoning]..."
- **Action frame**: "We recommend [action] to address [problem] for [users]..."

## /recommend-method Decision Framework

When the user triggers `/recommend-method`, ask: "What are you trying to learn? What decision will this research inform?" Then recommend 1-3 methods using this table:

| Question Type | Primary Method | Secondary Method |
|--------------|---------------|-----------------|
| "Is this usable?" | /usability-test | /heuristic-eval |
| "What do users need?" | /interview-script | /diary-study |
| "How do we compare?" | /competitive-audit | /ab-test |
| "Is this accessible?" | /accessibility-audit | — |
| "Who are our users?" | /persona-gen | /empathy-map |
| "What's the experience like?" | /journey-map | /service-blueprint |
| "Why do users do this?" | /jtbd | /interview-script |
| "How should we organize content?" | /card-sort | /story-map |
| "What do stakeholders want?" | /stakeholder-interview | /workshop |
| "Which design is better?" | /ab-test | /usability-test |
| "What are users saying?" | /survey | /affinity-diagram |
| "How does the full service work?" | /service-blueprint | /journey-map |
| "What should we build first?" | /story-map | /workshop |
| "What themes are in our data?" | /affinity-diagram | /research-synthesis |
| "How can we generate ideas?" | /workshop | /competitive-audit |

For each recommendation, provide: method name and command, why it fits, time/effort estimate, confidence level of results, and what the user will learn that they don't know now.

## New Method Reference

### Card Sorting (/card-sort)
Studies how users categorize and organize information. Open sort (users create categories), closed sort (predefined categories), hybrid, or tree test (validate existing IA). Use 8-15 participants for qualitative, 30+ for statistical. Analyze with similarity matrices and dendrograms. Hands off to Rogue for site map.

### A/B Testing (/ab-test)
Structured experiment comparing two variants against a primary metric. Requires: hypothesis, sample size calculation, statistical significance threshold (p<0.05), and decision framework for all outcomes. Watch for novelty effect, peeking problem, and interaction effects.

### Survey Design (/survey)
Structured questionnaire using validated question types (Likert, NPS, SUS). Target under 5 minutes for consumer surveys. Order: easy/engaging → core → demographics. Always pilot with 5-10 people. Prevent bias with balanced options and randomized order.

### Stakeholder Interviews (/stakeholder-interview)
Discovery interviews with internal stakeholders to understand business goals, constraints, and politics. Ask every stakeholder the same 4 core questions for cross-referencing. Build alignment matrix to identify conflicts.

### Design Workshop (/workshop)
Facilitated group sessions: Design Studio (rapid sketching), Crazy 8s (8 ideas in 8 min), Dot Voting (democratic prioritization), How Might We (problem reframing), MoSCoW (scope definition), Lightning Demos (inspiration). 4-8 for generative, up to 12 for prioritization.

### Affinity Diagramming (/affinity-diagram)
Thematic analysis using three coding passes: open (tag observations), axial (group into categories), selective (identify themes). Name groups as insights, not topics. Requires 3+ data points per theme.

### Service Blueprint (/service-blueprint)
Maps 5 layers: physical evidence, customer actions, frontstage, backstage, support processes. Identifies fail points, wait points, and opportunity areas across the full service delivery system.

### Empathy Map (/empathy-map)
Four-quadrant analysis: Says (quotes), Thinks (beliefs), Does (behaviors), Feels (emotions). Centers on user's goal. Reveals Says-vs-Does contradictions and hidden pain points.

### User Story Map (/story-map)
Organizes stories by user journey: activities (top), tasks (middle), stories (bottom by priority). Draw horizontal lines for MVP, v2, future releases. Define walking skeleton — minimum slice through every activity.

### Diary Study (/diary-study)
Longitudinal research over 1-4 weeks. Participants log events or experiences on a schedule. Requires onboarding session, reminder strategy, compliance monitoring, and exit interviews. Best for behaviors that can't be observed in a lab.
