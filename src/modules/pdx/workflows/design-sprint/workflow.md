# PDX Design Sprint Workflow

## Trigger
User invokes this workflow with a feature or improvement area:
- "Run a design sprint on the packing screen"
- "Design sprint: add social features"
- "PDX sprint: improve onboarding"

## Step 0: Project Detection

Check for these files in order:

1. `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml` — exists?
2. `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/prd.md` — exists?
3. `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture.md` — exists?
4. `_bmad-output/pdx-artifacts/` — any files exist?

**If sprint-status.yaml exists → BROWNFIELD**
This is an active project with existing sprints. Reference existing artifacts, continue numbering.
Pipeline: Nova → Kai → Echo → Sage → Relay → PM → SM (7 phases)

**If prd.md exists but no sprint-status.yaml → MID-PROJECT**
Planning happened but implementation hasn't started. Skip Analyst, include Architect.
Pipeline: PM → Nova → Kai → Echo → Architect → Sage → Relay → PM → SM (9 phases)

**If nothing exists → GREENFIELD**
Brand new project. Run full pipeline including Analyst, PM, and Architect.
Pipeline: Analyst → PM → Nova → Kai → Echo → Architect → Sage → Relay → PM → SM (11 phases)

Report detection to user:
"Detected: [GREENFIELD/BROWNFIELD/MID-PROJECT]. Running [X]-phase pipeline."

## Pre-flight (after detection)
1. Read any existing BMAD artifacts identified during detection
2. Read `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/project-context.md` if it exists
3. Read existing `_bmad-output/pdx-artifacts/` — don't repeat prior work
4. Ask user ONE clarifying question if scope is ambiguous
5. Confirm: "I'll run the [GREENFIELD/BROWNFIELD/MID-PROJECT] pipeline on [scope]. Ready?"

## GREENFIELD Pipeline (11 phases)
For brand new projects with no existing BMAD artifacts.

### Phase 0: Analyst (BMAD)
Brainstorm and create product brief:
- Interactive discovery session with user
- Capture product vision, target users, core problem, key features
- Output: `product-brief.md` → `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/`
- Report: "Phase 0 complete — product brief created"

### Phase 1: PM (BMAD)
Create PRD from product brief:
- Functional requirements, non-functional requirements
- Epics and high-level story mapping
- User types and success metrics
- Output: `prd.md` → `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/`
- Report: "Phase 1 complete — PRD created with [n] epics"

### Phase 2: Nova (PDX Research)
Generate foundational research from PRD. Nova auto-selects methods based on what the project needs:

**Always run (greenfield foundation):**
- `/persona-gen` — generate personas from PRD user descriptions
- `/competitive-audit` — competitive analysis of similar products
- `/jtbd` — map core user jobs with functional, emotional, and social dimensions

**Run if needed (based on scope and complexity):**
- `/journey-map` — if the feature involves multi-step user flows
- `/heuristic-eval` — if redesigning an existing product or feature
- `/interview-script` — if user research sessions are planned
- `/stakeholder-interview` — if multiple stakeholders have input on this feature

**Run if requested:**
- `/card-sort` — if information architecture decisions are needed
- `/survey` — if quantitative validation is needed before design
- `/empathy-map` — if user segments need deeper emotional analysis
- `/ab-test` — if comparing design approaches quantitatively

Nova selects automatically based on PRD content and scope. If unsure, Nova asks one question: "Do you want foundational research only, or should I go deeper?"

- Output: `personas.md`, `competitive-audit.md`, `jtbd.md` (minimum) → `_bmad-output/pdx-artifacts/`
- Additional artifacts based on methods selected
- Report: "Phase 2 complete — [n] research artifacts produced using [methods list]"

### Phase 3: Kai (PDX Design)
Create full product design from research:
- Site map / information architecture for full product
- User flows for each epic
- Wireframes for key screens
- State diagrams for complex components
- Output: `site-map.md`, `user-flow-*.md`, `wireframe-*.md` → `_bmad-output/pdx-artifacts/`
- Report: "Phase 3 complete — [n] design artifacts produced"

### Phase 4: Echo (PDX Content)
Write all product content:
- Voice and tone guidelines
- All screen microcopy
- Error message system
- Empty states for all screens
- Onboarding copy
- Output: `voice-tone.md`, `microcopy-*.md`, `error-messages.md`, `empty-states.md` → `_bmad-output/pdx-artifacts/`
- Report: "Phase 4 complete — [n] content artifacts produced"

### Phase 5: Architect (BMAD)
Create technical architecture:
- System architecture based on PRD + PDX design artifacts
- Tech stack decisions informed by component specs
- Data model, API design, infrastructure
- Output: `architecture.md` → `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/`
- Report: "Phase 5 complete — architecture document created"

### Phase 6: Sage (PDX QA)
Quality gate on all design work:
- Design review on all Kai artifacts
- Accessibility audit
- Content QA on all Echo output
- Pre-handoff quality gate
- IF NO-GO → loop back to relevant phase with issues
- IF GO/CONDITIONAL → continue
- Output: `qa-report.md` → `_bmad-output/pdx-artifacts/`
- Report: "Phase 6 complete — verdict: [GO/CONDITIONAL/NO-GO]"

### Phase 7: Relay (PDX Handoff)
Generate all implementation artifacts:
- Generate epic and story files from design artifacts
- Component specs for all new components
- Design tokens in W3C DTCG format
- Output: stories → `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/stories/`
- Output: `component-specs.md`, `design-tokens.json` → `_bmad-output/pdx-artifacts/`

After generating stories, Relay also compiles all PDX artifacts into
`_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/UX_Design.md` for BMAD dev agent compatibility.
This ensures the dev agent has a consolidated UX spec in the format it expects,
replacing Sally's output with PDX's richer pipeline output. Run task
`export-ux-design.md` automatically — no separate command needed.

- Report: "Phase 7 complete — [n] stories generated ([story range]), UX_Design.md compiled"

### Phase 8: PM (BMAD) — Story Review
Validate stories against PRD:
- Check story alignment with PRD and product goals
- Validate prioritization (P0/P1/P2)
- Verify acceptance criteria are complete and testable
- Identify missing or out-of-scope stories
- IF APPROVED → continue
- IF FLAGGED → pause for user confirmation
- Output: updated story files, `pm-review-[scope].md` → `_bmad-output/pdx-artifacts/`
- Report: "Phase 8 complete — PM review: [APPROVED/APPROVED WITH CHANGES/FLAGGED]"

### Phase 9: SM (BMAD) — Sprint Planning
Plan and assign sprints:
- Read team velocity and capacity
- Assign stories to sprints (P0 first)
- Sequence work within sprints
- IF total points exceed capacity → split across sprints
- Output: updated `sprint-status.yaml`, `sprint-plan-[sprint-number].md` → `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/`
- Report: "Phase 9 complete — stories assigned to Sprint [number], [points] points planned"

### Phase 10: Dev (BMAD) — Implementation
Stories are ready for development:
- Pick up stories with `/ds`
- All design context available in `pdx-artifacts/`
- Architecture available in `planning-artifacts/`

---

## BROWNFIELD Pipeline (7 phases)
For existing projects with sprint-status.yaml.

### Phase 2: Nova (PDX Research)
Targeted research on the feature scope. Nova auto-selects methods based on what's needed:

**Always run (brownfield baseline):**
- Reference existing personas — update if the feature introduces new user types
- `/heuristic-eval` or `/journey-map` for the specific feature area

**Run if needed (based on feature scope):**
- `/competitive-audit` — only if the feature is entirely new to the product
- `/usability-test` — if redesigning an existing flow with known pain points
- `/empathy-map` — if the feature targets a user segment not well-covered by existing personas

**Skip unless requested:**
- `/persona-gen` — personas already exist, only update
- `/jtbd` — existing JTBD likely covers this scope
- `/stakeholder-interview` — only if new stakeholders are involved

Nova selects automatically based on existing artifacts and feature scope.

- Output → `_bmad-output/pdx-artifacts/`
- Report: "Phase 2 complete — [n] research artifacts produced using [methods list]"

### Phase 3: Kai (PDX Design)
Design solutions for the feature:
- User flows for the specific feature
- State diagrams for complex components
- Wireframes for new/changed screens only
- Output → `_bmad-output/pdx-artifacts/`
- Report: "Phase 3 complete — [n] design artifacts produced"

### Phase 4: Echo (PDX Content)
Content for new/changed screens:
- Microcopy for new screens
- Error messages for new error states
- Empty states for new screens
- Output → `_bmad-output/pdx-artifacts/`
- Report: "Phase 4 complete — [n] content artifacts produced"

### Phase 6: Sage (PDX QA)
Focused QA on new designs:
- Design review on new designs only
- Accessibility check on new/changed screens
- IF NO-GO → loop back to Kai
- Output → `_bmad-output/pdx-artifacts/`
- Report: "Phase 6 complete — verdict: [GO/CONDITIONAL/NO-GO]"

### Phase 7: Relay (PDX Handoff)
Handoff continuing from existing state:
- Stories continue from existing numbering
- Append to existing epics or create new ones
- Component specs for new components only
- Tokens added to existing token file
- Output: stories → `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/stories/`

After generating stories, Relay also updates
`_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/UX_Design.md` with the new/changed sections.
If UX_Design.md doesn't exist yet, generate it fresh. If it exists, update
only the sections affected by this sprint's design work.

- Report: "Phase 7 complete — [n] stories generated ([story range]), UX_Design.md updated"

### Phase 8: PM (BMAD) — Story Review
Same as greenfield Phase 8.

### Phase 9: SM (BMAD) — Sprint Planning
Fit new stories into current or next sprint.

---

## MID-PROJECT Pipeline (9 phases)
PRD exists but no sprints yet. Skip Analyst, include Architect.

### Phase 1: PM (BMAD) — PRD Review
Review existing PRD (validate, don't recreate):
- Confirm PRD is current and complete
- Flag any gaps or outdated sections
- Output: updated `prd.md` if changes needed
- Report: "Phase 1 complete — PRD validated"

### Phases 2-4: Nova → Kai → Echo
Same as greenfield Phases 2-4.

### Phase 5: Architect (BMAD)
Same as greenfield Phase 5.

### Phases 6-9: Sage → Relay → PM → SM
Same as greenfield Phases 6-9.
